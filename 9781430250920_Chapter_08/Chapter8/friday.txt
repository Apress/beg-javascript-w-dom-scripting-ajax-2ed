I don't care if monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's friday I'm in love

Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's friday I'm in love

Saturday wait
And sunday always comes too late
But friday never hesitate...
